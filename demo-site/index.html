                Travel writing’s relationship to empire building— as a type of “colonialist discourse”—has drawn the most
                attention from academicians.
                Close connections have been observed between European (and American) political, economic, and administrative
                goals for the colonies
                and their manifestations in the cultural practice of writing travel books.
                Travel writers’ descriptions of foreign places have been analyzed as attempts to validate, promote,
                or challenge the ideologies and practices of colonial or imperial domination and expansion. Mary Louise
                Pratt’s study of the genres and conventions of 18th- and 19th-century exploration narratives about South
                America and Africa (e.g., the “monarch of all I survey” trope) offered ways of thinking about travel writing
                as embedded within relations of power between metropole and periphery, as did Edward Said’s theories of
                representation and cultural imperialism. Particularly Said’s book, Orientalism, helped scholars understand
                ways in which representations of people in travel texts were intimately bound up with notions of self, in
                this case, that the Occident defined itself through essentialist, ethnocentric, and racist representations
                of the Orient. Said’s work became a model for demonstrating cultural forms of imperialism in travel texts,
                showing how the political, economic, or administrative fact of dominance relies on legitimating discourses
                such as those articulated through travel writing. . . .
